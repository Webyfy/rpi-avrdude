# rpi-avrdude

Fixing the lack of a DTR pin on the Raspberry Pi for the purposes of uploading hex files to the arduino via RPi's UART.

This project is based on https://github.com/Siytek/avrdude-rpi, which ultimately is based on https://github.com/deanmao/avrdude-rpi (via multiple levels of forking)
